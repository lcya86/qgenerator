My regular day walking to work at NAB,"This is the laneway that I would walk down everyday on the way to work when I was working at NAB. I read once that walking on cobblestone was good for your circulation and I would often take big deep breaths in the morning as grandpa ##### used to say this was a good way to start the day. It would take me about 10 minutes to walk to Burnley station and every now and then I would leave at the same time as Tommy and walk with him, which I always enjoyed. 
On this particular day it was Feb 14th, Valentine'",9
